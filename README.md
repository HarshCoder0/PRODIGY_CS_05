# 📡 Network Packet Analyzer (Task-05)
*A Prodigy Infotech Internship Project — Task 05*

Developed by **AREMU DAVID ADEKANOLA**

## 📌 Overview

This project is a Python-based **Network Packet Analyzer** that functions as a simple packet sniffer. It captures and analyzes packets on a given network interface. The tool displays critical network traffic data such as:

- Source IP Address  
- Destination IP Address  
- Protocol Type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)  
- Payload Data (in readable format, where applicable)

🔐 **Note:** This tool is intended solely for educational and ethical testing purposes.

## 🛠 Features

✅ Real-time packet capture  
✅ Displays IP source/destination  
✅ Identifies protocol used  
✅ Parses and shows payload data  
✅ Works across different platforms with `scapy`

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Uses `scapy` to sniff packets.
2. Extracts IP and protocol info from each packet.
3. Filters and logs the necessary data for analysis.
4. Optionally logs the data into a text or `.pcap` file.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `scapy` library

> Install requirements with:
```bash
pip install scapy

```
